# Chess Database Analysis and Normalization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and normalizing a comprehensive chess games database. It serves as a demonstration of advanced SQL skills, including data cleaning, normalization, and analysis, designed to extract meaningful insights from raw data. 

### Features:
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressing inconsistencies and ensuring data quality for reliable analysis.
- **Normalization:** Structuring the database into a relational schema to eliminate redundancy and improve efficiency.
- **Analysis:** Extracting insights such as player rating trends, popular openings, and performance metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL Server**: For database storage and querying.
- **Jupyter Notebook (with PyODBC)**: For integrating Python and SQL workflows.
- **Pandas**: For pre-upload data cleaning and transformation.

## File Descriptions

1. **`analyzing.sql`**:
   - Contains SQL queries and procedures for analyzing chess games.
   - Includes advanced techniques to calculate rating changes, determine winning percentages, and identify popular strategies.

2. **`cleaning and normalization.sql`**:
   - Focuses on cleaning raw data imported from external sources.
   - Implements normalization techniques to restructure data for efficiency and integrity.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```
2. Set up a SQL Server instance and load the provided scripts in the correct sequence:
   - Start with `cleaning and normalization.sql` for preparing the database.
   - Use `analyzing.sql` to run insights and analysis queries.
3. Optionally, connect the database to Python using PyODBC for further automation and reporting.

## Insights and Portfolio Value

This project demonstrates proficiency in:
- **SQL Query Optimization**: Efficiently handling large datasets.
- **Database Design**: Structuring data for performance and scalability.
- **Data Analysis**: Extracting actionable insights from structured data.

## Future Enhancements

- Automating ETL processes with Python scripts.
- Integrating visual dashboards using tools like Tableau or Power BI.
- Extending analysis to include machine learning predictions for chess strategies.
